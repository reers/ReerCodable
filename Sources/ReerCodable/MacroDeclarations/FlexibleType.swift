/// A macro that enables flexible type conversion during decoding.
///
/// When applied to a property or type, this macro allows for automatic type conversion between basic types
/// during the decoding process. It supports conversions between:
/// - Numbers (Int, Double, Float, etc.)
/// - Strings and Numbers
/// - Booleans and Numbers (0/1)
/// - Booleans and Strings ("true"/"false", "yes"/"no")
///
/// Example usage:
/// ```swift
/// struct User: Codable {
///     @FlexibleType
///     var age: Int // Can decode from String "25" or Double 25.0
///
///     @FlexibleType
///     var isActive: Bool // Can decode from Int 1/0 or String "true"/"false"
/// }
///
/// @FlexibleType
/// struct Settings: Codable {
///     // All properties in this type will support flexible type conversion
///     var count: Int
///     var enabled: Bool
///     var name: String
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The supported type conversions are defined in the `TypeConvertible` protocol implementations.
